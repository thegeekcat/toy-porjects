# My Dev Diary



## 1. Start a new project

- **May.25.2023 (Thur) - The beginning of the project**
  - I am studying **Data Analysis and Computer Vision** from **Microsoft AI School** course, and there was a Town Hall meeting today.
  - A classmate suggested me to make a team to attend a Data Analysis Competition about Culture and Tourism in a historical city in Korea; and I said okay for sure
  - Issue: The submission day is June.16.2023, so we have only three weeks; but we agree to be meaningful in having an experience ðŸ˜˜
  - The Kick-off meeting is scheduled on May.29.2023 (Mon)



## 2. Gather Data

- **May.29.2023 (Mon) - The Kick-Off Meeting**

  - Possible topics, resources for dataset, etc. were discussed

  - A rough schedule was set: June.01.2023(Thur)

    

- **May.30.2023 (Tue) - Issues: Web scrapping**

  - First time, I had tried to do screen scrapping from Social Network Services, such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube

  - There are few websites and YouTube videos about web scrapping from those Social Network Services, but all of them didn't work (+ videos were at least 2 years ago)

  - I think it's blocked as data on those websites are directly related to marketing revenue

    

- **May.31.2023 (Wed) - Issue: Korean Encoding**

  - I gave up to do the screen scrapping, and had started to gather data from public government websites providing open data for free
  - I believe I could gather quite meaningful data to get some insights for a good result; was so satisfied
  - Luckily, I could download useful data, but had faced a serious issue that most of dataset was encoded as 'CP949', so spent a few hours to search the best way to solve it - SOLVED!

  

- **June.01.2023 (Thur) - Check the dataset**

  - We had our second meeting to review all data each gathered until the point; and we were satisfying!
  - Next meeting is scheduled on June.06.2023 (Tue); and task till then is to clean all data
